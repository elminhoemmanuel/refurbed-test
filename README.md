### My Note
Hello this is from Emmanuel, It was great working on this exercise.I have built the component using HTML and tailwindcss and have also added the javascript fucntionalities. I hope I have adopted the right approach as I was abit confused if the name product card component meant this should be done using custom vanilla js web components. If that is the case and it is to be done using custom vanilla js web components, please do reach out as I am ready to effect that change? However this approach also works and I hope you like it.
